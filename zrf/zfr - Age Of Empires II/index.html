                    In this game you can play different Campaigns, Random Maps, Regicide, Death Match and can also Save
                    your game. <br><br>

                    <b>Campaigns:</b> There are 5 different Campaigns (missions), in the Campaign section you will need
                    to collect <b>wood, food, gold and stone</b> through your villagers. After that you can make
                    different fighters such as Swords Men, Cavalery, Seig units, war ships by spending these wood, food
                    etc. At last you will attack on your target or in some missions you will defend your allies.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Random Map:</b> In trail version there is only one map (coastle) and only on tribe (Celts) for
                    you but in this game there are about 7 tribes, you can select either of them. Also in trail version
                    there are only 2 computer players but in this version you can select the computer players from 1 -
                    13. With addition you can also change Difficulty level, Map Size, Map Type, Resources amount,
                    Population limit (25 - 200), Reveal Map, Starting Age (Dark age - Post Imperial age) and Victory
                    type. <br><br>
                    <b>Regicide:</b> Regicide is similar to Random Map but in this section you will have a king, if your
                    king is killed, you are defeated. <br><br>
                    <b>Death Match:</b> In Death Match you and your oppositions will have alot of resources from the
                    start, you will just create army and fight WAR with your oppositions. It is also similar to Random
                    Map in settings like you can change the scenario by your own choice. <br><br>
                    <b>Saved Game:</b> In this section you will get the games you have saved whether in Campaigns,
                    Random Map, Regicide, or Death Match.
